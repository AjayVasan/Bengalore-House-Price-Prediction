# Bengaluru House Price Prediction

A machine learning model that predicts real estate prices in Bengaluru with 95% accuracy, integrating data science techniques and web development for accessible property valuation.

## 📌 Project Overview

This project implements a house price prediction model for Bangalore, India, using machine learning techniques to provide accurate real estate valuations based on genuine factors rather than inflated market prices. The system:

- Predicts property prices using multiple regression algorithms with 95% accuracy
- Offers a user-friendly web interface built with Flask for accessible predictions
- Deploys a fully functional application on the Heroku Cloud Platform
- Provides valuable insights into the Bengaluru real estate market through data visualization

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset contains Bengaluru housing information with multiple features:
- Area type
- Location
- Size (BHK)
- Total square feet
- Bathrooms
- Balconies
- Availability status
- Society name
